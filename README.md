Starting from the beggining, I am trying to build out a site to host digital and interactive maps to be used in RPG games. 
The maps need to be querable, and have the easy funtionality of a GIS mapviewer. 
Within the maps with be embedded links to other maps to create a integrated network of resources for the DMs. 
The map contents themselves are generated seperately could potentially be access through various cgi program through form links or other systems.
